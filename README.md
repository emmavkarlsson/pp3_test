Hangman is a game where the player has to guess a word, and the only clue provided is the number of letters in the word which is given by underlines (for example, if the word is apple, the player will see _ _ _ _ _)
The player has 6 lives, and can guess 6 times with 6 different letters. When the player has guessed a letter which is in the word, the letter will be added to the right place in the word (for example, if guess is L in "apple", it will look like this: _ _ _ L _). For every incorrect guessed letter, the hangman will be more and more displayed to the user. If the player hasn't guessed the word before running out of lives, the full hangman will be displayed and the player has lost.
